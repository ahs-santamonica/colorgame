How the sliders work:
Color Rush is a game based around who is the best at recognizing colors.
It is recommended for people who are not colorblind, but we encourage anyone to try this game out.
If you happen to be colorblind, think of yourself as playing this game on Hard Mode!
To start, there are three primary colors:  <span style="color: red">red</span>,  <span style="color: green">green</span>, and  <span style="color: blue">blue</span>
If you drag the sliders up and down, you can choose which color shows up more, and which one shows up less. 
Try mixing the sliders around to see what shades show up!
Rules of the game:
At the beginning of each round, a random color will appear on the top screen.
Your job will be to try to find the combination of sliders that comes closest to matching the color on top.
Try this now!
Now try it again, only this time, you have 30 seconds before the round is up.
Final practice round: the time limit is now 20 seconds.
